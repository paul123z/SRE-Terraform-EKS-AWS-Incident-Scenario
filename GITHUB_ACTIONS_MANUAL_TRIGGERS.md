# 🔄 GitHub Actions - Manual Triggers Only

## ✅ Current Configuration

All GitHub Actions workflows in this repository are configured to trigger **only manually** using `workflow_dispatch`.

## 📋 Workflow Files

### **1. `deploy.yml`**
- **Trigger**: `workflow_dispatch` (Manual only)
- **Purpose**: Complete infrastructure and application deployment
- **Jobs**: Test → Build & Push → Deploy → Terraform Plan (PR only)

### **2. `build-push-deploy-app.yml`**
- **Trigger**: `workflow_dispatch` (Manual only)
- **Purpose**: Build, push, and deploy application only
- **Jobs**: Build & Push & Deploy (single job)

### **3. `deploy-app-only.yml`**
- **Trigger**: `workflow_dispatch` (Manual only)
- **Purpose**: Deploy existing application image only
- **Jobs**: Deploy (single job)

## 🎯 Benefits of Manual Triggers

### **✅ Security**
- No accidental deployments from code pushes
- Full control over when deployments happen
- Prevents unauthorized infrastructure changes

### **✅ Cost Control**
- Deployments only when needed
- No unexpected AWS resource creation
- Better cost management for demo/learning projects

### **✅ Learning Focus**
- Intentional deployments for demonstrations
- Time to explain each step
- Perfect for YouTube recordings and tutorials
