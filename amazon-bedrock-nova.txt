Question for Amazon Bedrock:
"I'm trying to use Amazon's Nova Lite model in Bedrock but having trouble with the invocation. Here's my situation:
What I have:
✅ Nova Lite shows 'Access granted' in AWS Bedrock console
✅ AWS CLI is configured and working
✅ I can list foundation models
What I'm trying:


aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model 

--region us-east-1 

--model-id "amazon.nova-lite-2024-05-20-v1:0" 

--content-type "application/json" 

--body '{"prompt": "Hello! Test message", "max_tokens": 50, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.9}' 

--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out 

nova-test.json
The problem:
Command completes without error messages
But no response file is created
Silent failure
Questions:
What's the correct model ID for Nova Lite?
What's the correct request body format for Nova Lite?
Do I need to use inference profiles for Nova Lite?
What's the simplest working example to test Nova Lite?
Can you give me the exact working command to test Nova Lite?"


ANSWER:





To help you troubleshoot and successfully invoke the Amazon Nova Lite model in Amazon Bedrock, let's go through each of your questions and provide the necessary details.

1. Correct Model ID for Nova Lite
The model ID for Amazon Nova Lite should be in the format amazon.nova-lite-YYYY-MM-DD-v1:0. Ensure you are using the correct date version. For example, if the latest version is 2024-05-20, the model ID should be amazon.nova-lite-2024-05-20-v1:0.

2. Correct Request Body Format for Nova Lite
The request body should be in JSON format and include the necessary parameters for the model. Here's an example of the correct request body:

{
    "inputText": "Hello! Test message",
    "maxTokens": 50,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "topP": 0.9
}
3. Inference Profiles for Nova Lite
Inference profiles are not typically required for simple invocations. However, if you need to customize the model's behavior, you can create an inference profile in the Bedrock console.

4. Simplest Working Example to Test Nova Lite
Here's a simple working example to test the Nova Lite model:

aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --model-id "amazon.nova-lite-2024-05-20-v1:0" \
    --content-type "application/json" \
    --body '{"inputText": "Hello! Test message", "maxTokens": 50, "temperature": 0.7, "topP": 0.9}' \
    --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
    response.json
5. Exact Working Command to Test Nova Lite
Here's the exact command you can use to test the Nova Lite model:

aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --model-id "amazon.nova-lite-2024-05-20-v1:0" \
    --content-type "application/json" \
    --body '{"inputText": "Hello! Test message", "maxTokens": 50, "temperature": 0.7, "topP": 0.9}' \
    --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
    response.json
Additional Steps
Check the Output File: Ensure that the response.json file is created in the current directory and contains the response from the model.
Check AWS Credentials and Permissions: Ensure that your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions to invoke the model.
If the command still completes without errors but no response file is created, you might want to check the output of the command directly by removing the response.json part:

aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --model-id "amazon.nova-lite-2024-05-20-v1:0" \
    --content-type "application/json" \
    --body '{"inputText": "Hello! Test message", "maxTokens": 50, "temperature": 0.7, "topP": 0.9}' \
    --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out
This will print the response directly to the console, which can help you debug the issue.
