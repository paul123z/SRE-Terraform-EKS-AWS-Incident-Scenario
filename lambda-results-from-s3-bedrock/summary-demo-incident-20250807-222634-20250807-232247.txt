AI-POWERED INCIDENT ANALYSIS SUMMARY
=====================================
Incident ID: demo-incident-20250807-222634
Analysis Time: 2025-08-07 23:22:44

Incident Type: Memory leak simulation incident with HPA scaling issues
Severity: MEDIUM
Duration: Approximately 2 minutes (20:26:55 - 20:28:08)

Primary Cause: Memory leak simulation was enabled in the application via API call, causing potential memory consumption issues

Immediate Fixes:
- HIGH: Disabled memory leak simulation via application API
- HIGH: Restarted affected pods to clear memory state

Key Recommendations:
- MONITORING: Deploy and configure metrics-server properly to resolve HPA metrics collection failures
- ALERTING: Create alerts for HPA scaling failures and resource metrics API unavailability
- INFRASTRUCTURE: Set appropriate resource requests and limits on pods to enable proper HPA functionality
- PROCESS: Implement runbooks for memory leak incidents including automated detection and remediation steps
- MONITORING: Add memory usage trends and leak detection to application dashboards
