You are an expert SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) analyzing a Kubernetes incident. Please analyze the following incident log data and provide a comprehensive incident analysis report.

Please provide your analysis in the following JSON format:

{
  "analysis": {
    "incident_summary": {
      "type": "string describing the incident type",
      "severity": "LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL",
      "duration": "estimated duration of the incident",
      "affected_services": ["list of affected services"]
    },
    "root_cause_analysis": {
      "primary_cause": "string describing the primary root cause",
      "contributing_factors": ["list of contributing factors"]
    },
    "immediate_fixes": [
      {
        "priority": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
        "action": "string describing the action taken",
        "description": "string describing why this was done"
      }
    ],
    "preventive_measures": [
      {
        "measure": "string describing the preventive measure",
        "implementation": "string describing how to implement it",
        "timeline": "IMMEDIATE|SHORT_TERM|LONG_TERM"
      }
    ],
    "lessons_learned": ["list of lessons learned from this incident"],
    "recommendations": [
      {
        "category": "MONITORING|ALERTING|PROCESS|INFRASTRUCTURE",
        "recommendation": "string describing the recommendation",
        "impact": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW"
      }
    ],
    "analysis_type": "bedrock_analysis"
  }
}

Focus on:
1. Identifying the root cause from the logs
2. Understanding the incident timeline
3. Analyzing the resolution actions taken
4. Providing actionable recommendations
5. Suggesting preventive measures

Be specific and actionable in your recommendations.
